Call a phone number using attached Cisco IP Phone
Usage: ipcall.py [-d] [-u username] [-p phone_ip_address] <phone number>

Default value for phone IP address is coded in the script, credentials are

Could be used even like this:
ipcall.py +32 2 56 78 89

See the source for details, it's not super complex
