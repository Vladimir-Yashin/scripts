This is a wrapper around any redirected RDP application.
It uses xfreerdp to run applications, but it makes it
completely transparent to user due to leveraging local keyring for storing user password.

It asks user for a password during first-time login and stores it in user keyring (kwallet, gnome-keyring, whatever)
