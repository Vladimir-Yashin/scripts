These scripts act like hdmi-helper, but they
can be used in multi-user environment.
video-helper.sh changes screen resolution and configuration upon connecting/disconnecting VGA output,
but it requires .Xauthority and DISPLAY variable (because X is running from user account)

For this purpose video-helper-user.sh is executed immediate after user login. It creates file in /tmp
with all required data.
